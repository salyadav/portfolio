      `I am a Computer Science master's student at Georgia Tech, an experienced Frontend Engineer, User Experience enthusiast, and Human-Computer Interaction researcher. 
      Constantly maneuvering the realms of usability, design, and performance, I am interested in exploring that thin line where engineering and art fuse into a game-changer. 
      I understand the importance of subtle details, and I understand the challenges of tech. 
      With a ubiquitous take on user-centered design, and the attention-to-detail as a researcher, I am ready for the world of Product.`, 
      `
      I have a diverse background from building MVPs, conducting ethnographic field research, designing UX prototypes, to building core frontend architecture 
      and end-to-end development of collaborative digital marketing platform. With over four years of industry experience in leading projects, 
      and data-driven exploration of our users needs, I can build a product not only usable but also an absolute treat to engage with!
      `, 
      `In addition, I am a strong advocate of sustainable development and want to be a part of an organization that empathizes with my vision of imbibing 
      sustenance at a granular level.`

To her credit, her ability to multitask combined with the capacity to absorb a steep learning gradient, I can certainly endorse her as an asset to any team/org that she's a part of.`,
