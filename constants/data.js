      ,
      `I am a Computer Science masters student at Georgia Tech, an experienced Frontend Engineer, User Experience enthusiast, and Human-Computer Interaction researcher. 
      Constantly maneuvering the realms of usability, design, and performance, I am interested in exploring that thin line where engineering and art fuse into a game-changer. 
      I understand the importance of subtle details, and I understand the challenges of tech. 
      With a ubiquitous take on user-centered design, and the attention-to-detail as a researcher, I am ready for the world of Product.`, 
      `
      I have experience in a wide range of disciplines including firmware, software, web dev, digital marketing, 
      interaction design, minimum viable products, data visualization, health informatics, UX design, qualitative field research, and ethnography. 
      These experiences have given me a unique outlook on what makes a product not only usable but an absolute treat to engage with!

Her constant endeavour to table a fresh outlook to every problem statement that was deliberated upon is something that was highly appreciated by one and all. To her credit, her ability to multitask combined with the capacity to absorb a steep learning gradient, I can certainly endorse her as an asset to any team/org that she's a part of.`,
